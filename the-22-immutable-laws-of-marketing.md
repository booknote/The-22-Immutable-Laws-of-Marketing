# The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
By Al Ries & Jack Trout

## Chapter 1: The law of leadership

* It’s better to be first than it is to be better.
* It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone
you have a better product than the one that did get there first.
* One reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the name
often becomes generic.
* If you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always
try to select a name that can work generically.

## Chapter 2: The law of the category

* If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first
in.
* When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not
“How is this new product better than the competition?” but “First what?”
In other words, what category is this new product first in?
* Forget the brand. Think categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new.
* When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence,
you have no competition.

## Chapter 3: The law of the mind

* It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace.
* Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows
you to get in the mind first.
* You want to change something in a mind? Forget it. Once a mind is made up,
it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing you can do in
marketing is try to change a mind.

## Chapter 4: The law of perception

* Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perceptions.
* There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are
perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the
reality. Everything else is an illusion. All truth is relative.
* Marketing is a manipulation of those perceptions.
* Minds of customers or prospects are very difficult to change. With a modicum
of experience in a product category, a consumer assumes that he or she is
right. A perception that exists in the mind is often interpreted as a universal
truth. People are seldom, if ever, wrong. At least in their own minds.

> Japanese automobile manufacturers sell the same cars in the United
States as they do in Japan. If marketing were a battle of products, you would
think the same sales order would hold true for both countries. After all, the
same quality, the same styling, the same horsepower, and roughly the same
prices hold true for Japan as they do for the United States.

> If you told friends in New York you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What
kind of car did you get? a Civic? an Accord? a Prelude?” If you told friends
in Tokyo you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What kind of motorcycle did
you buy?” In Japan, Honda got into customers’ minds as a manufacturer of
motorcycles, and apparently most people don’t want to buy a car from a
motorcycle company.

>According to the ads, German automotive experts rated Audi cars ahead of
both Mercedes and BMW. Do you believe that? Probably not. Is it true? Does it
matter? Marketing is not a battle of products. It’s a battle of perceptions.

## Chapter 5: The law of focus

* The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s
mind.
* You “burn” your way into the mind by narrowing the focus to a single word or
concept.

> You can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association
test. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the
four most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey’s, and Coke.

* If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more
important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category.
* The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented. No matter how
complicated the product, no matter how complicated the needs of the market,
it’s always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two or three or
four.
* If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a
lot of other benefits, too. A “thicker” spaghetti sauce implies quality,
nourishing ingredients, value, and so on. A “safer” car implies better design
and engineering.
* The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you
reduce the scope of your operations. You can’t stand for something if you
chase after everything.
* Does any company proclaim itself as the “unquality” corporation? No,
everybody stands for quality. As a result, nobody does. You can’t narrow the
focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the
opposite point of view.
