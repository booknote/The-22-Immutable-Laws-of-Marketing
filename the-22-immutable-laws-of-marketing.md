# The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
By Al Ries & Jack Trout

## Chapter 1: The law of leadership

* It’s better to be first than it is to be better.
* It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone
you have a better product than the one that did get there first.
* One reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the name
often becomes generic.
* If you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always
try to select a name that can work generically.

## Chapter 2: The law of the category

* If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first
in.
* When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not
“How is this new product better than the competition?” but “First what?”
In other words, what category is this new product first in?
* Forget the brand. Think categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new.
* When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence,
you have no competition.

## Chapter 3: The law of the mind

* It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace.
* Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows
you to get in the mind first.
* You want to change something in a mind? Forget it. Once a mind is made up,
it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing you can do in
marketing is try to change a mind.

## Chapter 4: The law of perception

* Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perceptions.
* There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are
perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the
reality. Everything else is an illusion. All truth is relative.
* Marketing is a manipulation of those perceptions.
* Minds of customers or prospects are very difficult to change. With a modicum
of experience in a product category, a consumer assumes that he or she is
right. A perception that exists in the mind is often interpreted as a universal
truth. People are seldom, if ever, wrong. At least in their own minds.

> Japanese automobile manufacturers sell the same cars in the United
States as they do in Japan. If marketing were a battle of products, you would
think the same sales order would hold true for both countries. After all, the
same quality, the same styling, the same horsepower, and roughly the same
prices hold true for Japan as they do for the United States.

> If you told friends in New York you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What
kind of car did you get? a Civic? an Accord? a Prelude?” If you told friends
in Tokyo you bought a Honda, they might ask you, “What kind of motorcycle did
you buy?” In Japan, Honda got into customers’ minds as a manufacturer of
motorcycles, and apparently most people don’t want to buy a car from a
motorcycle company.

>According to the ads, German automotive experts rated Audi cars ahead of
both Mercedes and BMW. Do you believe that? Probably not. Is it true? Does it
matter? Marketing is not a battle of products. It’s a battle of perceptions.

## Chapter 5: The law of focus

* The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s
mind.
* You “burn” your way into the mind by narrowing the focus to a single word or
concept.

> You can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association
test. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the
four most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey’s, and Coke.

* If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more
important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category.
* The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented. No matter how
complicated the product, no matter how complicated the needs of the market,
it’s always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two or three or
four.
* If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a
lot of other benefits, too. A “thicker” spaghetti sauce implies quality,
nourishing ingredients, value, and so on. A “safer” car implies better design
and engineering.
* The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you
reduce the scope of your operations. You can’t stand for something if you
chase after everything.
* Does any company proclaim itself as the “unquality” corporation? No,
everybody stands for quality. As a result, nobody does. You can’t narrow the
focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the
opposite point of view.

## Chapter 6: The law of exclusivity

* Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind.
* When a competitor owns a word or position in the prospect’s mind, it is
futile to attempt to own the same word.
* You can’t change people’s minds once they are made up. In fact, what you
often do is reinforce your competitor’s position by making its concept more
important.

## Chapter 7: The law of ladder

* For each category, there is a product ladder in the mind. On each rung is a
brand name.

> Take the car rental category. Hertz got into the mind first and wound up on
the top rung. Avis got in second and National got in third.

* The one thing you have to do to make progress inside the mind of the prospect
is acknowledge your position on the ladder.
* The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which
information to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind
accepts only new data that is consistent with its product ladder in that
category. Everything else is ignored.
* The number of rungs on a ladder depends on whether your product is a
high-interest or a low-interest product. Products that are purchased
infrequently (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their
ladders.
* There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder
in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of the brand
below you and half the market share of the brand above you.
* There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind.
* Before starting any marketing program, ask yourself the following questions:
Where are we on the ladder in the prospect’s mind? On the top rung? On the
second rung? Or maybe we’re not on the ladder at all. Then make sure your
program deals realistically with your position on the ladder.

## Chapter 8: The law of duality

* In the long run, every market becomes a two horse race.
* Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder
becomes a two-rung affair.
* When you’re a weak No. 3, you aren’t going to make much progress by going
out and attacking the two strong leaders. What you could do is carve out a
profitable niche for themselves (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).
* As time goes on, however, these customers get educated. They want the leading
brand, based on the naive assumption that the leading brand must be better. We
repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products. It’s
this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: “They must be the
best, they’re the leaders.”

## Chapter 9: The law of opposite

* If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the
leader.
* In strength there is weakness. Wherever the leader is strong, there is an
opportunity for a would-be No. 2 to turn the tables.
* If you want to establish a firm foothold on the second rung of the ladder,
study the firm above you. Where is it strong? And how do you turn that
strength into a weakness? You must discover the essence of the leader and
then present the prospect with the opposite. (In other words, don’t try to be
better, try to be different.) It’s often the upstart versus old reliable.
* When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two
kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are
those who don’t want to buy from the leader.

> By positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all
the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink Coke and young people
drink Pepsi, there’s nobody left to drink Royal Crown cola.

* Don’t simply knock the competition. The law of the opposite is a two-edge
sword. It requires honing in on a weakness that your prospect will quickly
acknowledge.
* There has to be a ring of truth about the negative if it is to be effective.
* A good No. 2 can’t afford to be timid. When you give up focusing on No. 1,
you make yourself vulnerable not only to the leader but to the rest of the
pack.

## Chapter 10: The law of division

* Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories.
* A category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over
time, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes, minicomputers,
workstations, personal computers, laptops, notebooks, pen computers.
* Each segment has its own leader, which is rarely the same as the leader of
the original category.
* Categories are dividing, not combining.
* The way for the leader to maintain its dominance is to address each emerging
category with a different brand name.
* What keeps leaders from launching a different brand to cover a new category
is the fear of what will happen to their existing brands.

## Chapter 11: The law of perspective

* Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.
* There’s more and more evidence to show that sales decrease business in the
long term by educating customers not to buy at “regular” prices.
* Aside from the fact that you can buy something for less, what does a sale
say to a prospect? It says that your regular prices are too high. After the
sale is over, customers tend to avoid a store with a “sale” reputation.
* Any sort of couponing, discounts, or sales tends to educate consumers to
buy only when they can get a deal.

## Chapter 12: The law of extension

* There’s an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand.
* When a company becomes incredibly successful, it invariably plants the seeds
for its future problems.

> In a narrow sense, line extension involves taking the brand name of a
successful product (e.g., A-1 steak sauce) and putting it on a new product
you plan to introduce (e.g., A-1 poultry sauce). It sounds so logical. “We
make A-1, a great sauce that gets the dominant share of the steak business.
But people are switching from beef to chicken, so let’s introduce a poultry
product. And what better name to use than A-1. That way people will know the
poultry sauce comes from the makers of that great steak sauce, A-1.” But
marketing is a battle of perception, not product. In the mind, A-1 is not the
brand name, but the steak sauce itself.

* Invariably, the leader in any category is the brand that is not line extended.
* More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a
company makes, the less money it makes.
* Less is more. If you want to be successful today, you have to narrow the
focus in order to build a position in the prospect’s mind.

## Chapter 13: The law of sacrifice
* You have to give up something in order to get something.
* The law of sacrifice is the opposite of the law of line extension.
* There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and
constant change.
* First, the product line. Where is it written that the more you have to
sell, the more you sell? The full line is a luxury for a loser. If you want
to be successful, you have to reduce your product line, not expand it.

> The power of the sacrifice for Federal Express was in being able to put the
word overnight in the mind of the prospect. When it absolutely, positively had
to be there overnight, you would call Federal Express.Then what did Federal
Express do? The company did the same thing Emery did. It threw away its
overnight position by buying Tiger International’s Flying Tiger cargo line
for $880 million. Now Federal Express is a worldwide air cargo company without
a worldwide position. In just 21 months Federal Express lost $1.1 billion in
its international operations.

* The second sacrifice, target market. Where is it written that you have to
appeal to everybody
* The target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your marketing
is not the same as the people who will actually buy your product.

> Even though Pepsi-Cola’s target was the teenager, the market was everybody.
The 50-year-old guy who wants to think he’s 29 will drink the Pepsi.The target
of Marlboro advertising is the cowboy, but the market is everybody. Do you know
how many cowboys are left in America? Very few. (They’ve all been smoking
Marlboros.)

* Finally, the third sacrifice: constant change. Where is it written that you
have to change your strategy every year at budget review time? If you try to
follow the twists and turns of the market, you are bound to wind up off the
road. The best way to maintain a consistent position is not to change it in
the first place.

## Chapter 14: The law of attributes

* For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.
* Marketing is a battle of ideas. So if you are to succeed, you must have an
idea or attribute of your own to focus your efforts around. Without one, you
had better have a low price. A very low price.
* You must try and own the most important attribute. Cavity prevention is the
most important attribute in toothpaste. It’s the one to own. But the law of
exclusivity points to the simple truth that once an attribute is successfully
taken by your competition, it’s gone. You must move on to a lesser attribute
and live with a smaller share of the category. Your job is to seize a different
attribute, dramatize the value of your attribute, and thus increase your share.
* You can’t predict the size of a new attribute’s share, so never laugh.

> A single trip to any McDonald’s should be enough to find an attribute that
McDonald’s owns: “kids.” This is indeed the place to which kids drag their
parents. This sets up an opportunity vividly demonstrated by the Coke and
Pepsi battle. If McDonald’s owns kids, then Burger King has the opportunity
to position itself for the older crowd, which includes any kid who doesn’t
want to be perceived as a kid. That generally works out to be everyone over
the age of 10 (not a bad market). To make the concept work, Burger King would
have to invoke the law of sacrifice and give all the little kids to McDonald’s.
While this might mean getting rid of a few swing sets, it also allows Burger
King to hang “kiddieland” on McDonald’s (chapter 9: The Law of the Opposite).

## Chapter 15: The law of candor

* When you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.
* First and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement you
make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements, on
the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an
advertisement. You have to prove a positive statement to the prospect’s
satisfaction. No proof is needed for a negative statement.
* When a company starts a message by admitting a problem, people tend to,
almost instinctively, open their minds.
* The law of candor must be used carefully and with great skill. First, your
“negative” must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant
agreement with your prospect’s mind. If the negative doesn’t register quickly,
your prospect will be confused and will wonder, “What’s this all about?” Next,
you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to
apologize. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince
your prospect. This law only proves the old maxim: Honesty is the best policy.

## Chapter 16: The law of singularity

* In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results.
* Many marketing people see success as the sum total of a lot of small efforts
beautifully executed. They think they can pick and choose from a number of
different strategies and still be successful as long as they put enough effort
into the program. Trying harder is not the secret of marketing success.
* History teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single,
bold stroke.
* Successful generals study the battleground and look for that one bold stroke
that is least expected by the enemy. Finding one is difficult. Finding more
than one is usually impossible.

> Military strategist and author B.H. Liddell Hart calls this bold stroke “the
line of, least expectation.” The Allied invasion came at Normandy, a place
whose tide and rocky shore the Germans felt would be an unlikely choice for a
landing of any scale. So it is in marketing.

* Most often there is only one place where a competitor is vulnerable. And
that place should be the focus of the entire invading force.
* What works in marketing is the same as what works in the military: the
unexpected.
* To find that singular idea or concept, marketing managers have to know
what’s happening in the marketplace. They have to be down at the front in the
mud of the battle. They have to know what’s working and what isn’t. They have
to be involved.
* It’s hard to find that single move if you’re hanging around headquarters and
not involved in the process.

## Chapter 17: The law of unpredictability

* Unless you write your competitors’ plans, you can’t predict the future.
* Failure to forecast competitive reaction is a major reason for marketing
failures.
* Most of corporate America’s problems are not related to short-term marketing
thinking. The problem is short-term financial thinking. Most companies live
from quarterly report to quarterly report. That’s a recipe for problems.
Companies that live by the numbers, die by the numbers.
* Good short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that
differentiates your product or company. Then you set up a coherent long-term
marketing direction that builds a program to maximize that idea or angle.
* Research does best at measuring the past. New ideas and concepts are almost
impossible to measure. No one has a frame of reference.
* One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous amount of
flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping through your
category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly if you are to
survive in the long term.

> It’s probably true that a personal mainframe product would undermine IBM’s
two other main sources of revenue, but a company must be flexible enough to
attack itself with a new idea.

* Change isn’t easy, but it’s the only way to cope with an unpredictable future.

## Chapter 18: The law of success

* Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure.
* Ego is the enemy of successful marketing. Objectivity is what’s needed. When
people become successful, they tend to become less objective. They often
substitute their own judgment for what the market wants.
* Success is often the fatal element behind the rash of line extensions. When a
brand is successful, the company assumes the name is the primary reason for
the brand’s success.
* The brand got famous because you made the right marketing moves. In other
words, the steps you took were in tune with the fundamental laws of marketing.
You got into the mind first. You narrowed the focus. You preempted a powerful
attribute.
* Brilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They
put themselves in the shoes of their customers. They don’t impose their own
view of the world on the situation. (Keep in mind that the world is all
perception anyway, and the only thing that counts in marketing is the
customer’s perception.)
* Like kings, chief executives rarely get honest opinions from their ministers.
There’s too much intrigue going on at the court. Instead of talking things over,
 walk out and see for yourself.

>As Gorbachev told Reagan, “It is better to see once than to hear a hundred
times.”

* Small companies are mentally closer to the front than big companies. That
might be one reason they grew more rapidly in the last decade. They haven’t
been tainted by the law of success.

## Chapter 19: The law of failure

* Failure is to be expected and accepted.
* Too many companies try to fix things rather than drop things. “Let’s
reorganize to save the situation” is their way of life.
* A better strategy is to recognize failure early and cut your losses.

>IBM should have dropped copiers and Xerox should have dropped computers years
before they finally recognized their mistakes.

* In some American companies nothing gets done unless it benefits the personal
agenda of someone in top management. This severely limits the potential
marketing moves a company can make. If a company is going to operate in an
ideal way, it will take teamwork, esprit de corps, and a self-sacrificing
leader.

## Chapter 20: The law of the hype

> No soft drink has received more hype than New Coke. By one estimate,
New Coke received more than $1 billion worth of free publicity. Add to that
the hundreds of millions of dollars spent to launch the brand, and New Coke
should have been the world’s most successful product. It didn’t happen.

* The essence of the hype was not just that the new product was going to be
successful. The essence of the hype was that existing products would now be
obsolete.
* The only revolutions you can predict are the ones that have already started.
* Capturing the imagination of the public is not the same as revolutionizing a
market.
* Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage
on the 6:00 P.M. news. Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of
the night and kind of sneak up on you.

## Chapter 21: The law of acceleration

* Successful programs are not built on fads, they’re built on trends.
* A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little. Like a wave, a fad
is very visible, but it goes up and down in a big hurry. Like the tide, a
trend is almost invisible, but it’s very powerful over the long term.
* A fad is a short-term phenomenon that might be profitable, but a fad doesn’t
last long enough to do a company much good. Furthermore, a company often tends
to gear up as if a fad were a trend. As a result, the company is often stuck
with a lot of staff, expensive manufacturing facilities, and distribution
networks.
* Here’s the paradox. If you were faced with a rapidly rising business, with
all the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do would be to
dampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch the fad out and it becomes
more like a trend.
* The most successful entertainers are the ones who control their appearances.
They don’t overextend themselves. They’re not all over the place. They don’t
wear out their welcome.
* Forget fads. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to maintain
a long-term demand for your product is to never totally satisfy the demand.
But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend.

## Chapter 22: The law of resources

* Without adequate funding an idea won’t get off the ground.
* Even the best idea in the world won’t go very far without the money to get
it off the ground. Inventors, entrepreneurs, and assorted idea generators seem
to think that all their good ideas need is professional marketing help.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Marketing is a game fought in the
mind of the prospect. You need money to get into a mind. And you need money
to stay in the mind once you get there.
* Some entrepreneurs see publicity as a cheap way of getting into prospects’
minds. “Free advertising” is how they see it. Publicity isn’t free. Rule of
thumb: 5-10-20. A small public relations agency will want $5,000 a month to
promote your product; a medium- size agency, $10,000 a month; and a big-time
agency, $20,000 a month.
* Remember: An idea without money is worthless. Be prepared to give away a lot
for the funding. In marketing, the rich often get richer because they have the
resources to drive their ideas into the mind. Their problem is separating the
good ideas from the bad ones, and avoiding spending money on too many products
and too many programs (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).
