## Synopsis
Al Ries and Jack Trout, two of the world's most successful marketing
strategists, call upon over 40 years of marketing expertise to identify the
definitive rules that govern the world of marketing. Combining a wide-ranging
historical overview with a keen eye for the future, the authors bring to light
22 superlative tools and innovative techniques for the international
marketplace. The authors examine marketing campaigns that have succeeded and
others that have failed, why good ideas didn't live up to expectations, and
offer their own ideas on what would have worked better. The real-life examples,
common sense suggestions and killer instincts contained are nothing less than
rules by which companies will flourish or fail.
